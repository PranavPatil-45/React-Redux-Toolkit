javascript
{
  stocks: [
    {
      id: 1234567890,
      ticker: "AAPL",
      name: "Apple Inc.",
      qty: 10,
      price: 150.75
    },
    // ... more stocks
  ]
}

Update the initial state in StockForm.js

Add new form fields in the render method

Update the stockSlice.js to handle the new field

The application uses a combination of Bootstrap classes and custom CSS. The custom styles are defined within each component using JSX style tags. Modify these styles to change the appearance.
